      <h1>Privacy Policy – Candy Pop Quest</h1>
      <p class="muted">Last updated: 2025</p>

      <p>
        Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how data
        is collected and used inside the game <strong>Candy Pop Quest</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        The game may collect <strong>non-personal data only</strong>, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Usage statistics through Firebase Analytics.</li>
        <li>
          Advertising identifiers and related data through Google AdMob.
        </li>
        <li>
          Crash reports and technical diagnostics (e.g. Firebase Crashlytics).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do <strong>NOT</strong> collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your name, email address, phone number, or home address.</li>
        <li>
          Precise location data (only coarse location may be inferred by Google
          for fraud prevention and measurement).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Regional Differences and User Consent</h2>
      <p>
        Candy Pop Quest is played in different countries with different privacy
        laws.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In certain regions such as the European Economic Area (EEA) and the
          United Kingdom, we are required to ask for your consent before using
          data for analytics and personalized advertising.
        </li>
        <li>
          In other regions, Google AdMob and Firebase may operate under
          different legal bases, and personalized ads may be shown without an
          in-app consent dialog, as permitted by local regulations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When consent is required (for example in the EEA/UK), you will see a
        consent screen in the app:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you tap <strong>“Allow”</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li>Analytics will be enabled.</li>
            <li>Personalized ads may be shown where supported.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          If you tap <strong>“Decline”</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li>Analytics will be disabled.</li>
            <li>Only non-personalized ads (NPA) will be shown.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
      <p>
        This game uses Google AdMob to display ads and keep the game free to
        play.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Google may collect non-personal data (such as device identifiers, app
          usage events, and coarse location) to deliver, measure, and improve
          ads and to prevent fraud and abuse.
        </li>
        <li>
          In regions where consent is required, your choice on the consent
          screen controls whether ads are personalized or non-personalized.
        </li>
        <li>
          In other regions, personalized ads may be shown by default, as
          allowed by local laws and Google’s policies.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For more details on how Google uses data from apps like this one, you
        can review Google’s own policies, for example “How Google uses
        information from sites or apps that use our services”.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Analytics (Firebase Analytics)</h2>
      <p>
        We use Firebase Analytics to understand how players use the game,
        improve gameplay balance, fix bugs, and enhance the overall experience.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When analytics is enabled, anonymous usage statistics and events
          related to gameplay may be collected.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you decline consent in regions where consent is required,
          analytics is disabled and no analytics events are sent from your
          device.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not use Firebase Analytics to collect personally identifiable
        information (PII).
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your data.</p>
      <p>
        We may share limited data with the following third-party service
        providers, strictly for the purposes described above:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google AdMob – for displaying and measuring ads.</li>
        <li>
          Firebase services (such as Analytics and Crashlytics) – for
          analytics, crash reporting, and app diagnostics.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These third-party services handle data in accordance with their own
        privacy policies.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        All communication between the app and external services uses
        industry-standard encrypted connections (e.g. HTTPS).
      </p>
      <p>
        We apply reasonable technical measures to protect data against
        unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
      </p>

      <h2>7. User Choices and Rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In regions where a consent dialog is shown, you can choose
          “Allow” or “Decline” on the in-app privacy &amp; consent screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          In some versions of the game, you may also change your choice later
          from the in-game Settings screen (if provided).
        </li>
        <li>
          If you switch from Allow to Decline in those regions:
          <ul>
            <li>Analytics will be disabled.</li>
            <li>Only non-personalized ads (NPA) will be shown.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          If you switch from Decline to Allow:
          <ul>
            <li>Analytics will be enabled.</li>
            <li>Personalized ads may be used where supported.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Candy Pop Quest is designed as a family-friendly game. We do not
        knowingly collect personal information from children.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe that your child has provided us with personal
        information by mistake, please contact us and we will take steps to
        remove such information.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Policy Updates</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will
        be posted on this page and may also be reflected in the in-app privacy
        section.
      </p>
      <p>
        We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay
        informed about how we are protecting your data.
